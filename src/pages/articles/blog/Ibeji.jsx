          Early Beliefs and Superstitions In earlier African history, the birth
          of twins was shrouded in mystery and fear. Many believed that twins
          were the result of infidelity or supernatural forces. Among the
          Yoruba, the notion of a single woman giving birth to two children was
          unfathomable, leading to the belief that twins were harbingers of
          misfortune. This fear led to the tragic practice of infanticide, where
          both twins were killed at birth, and their mother faced social
          ostracism.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">A Shift in Perception</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          A significant turning point in Yoruba history changed this view. A
          legend tells of the oracle of Ifa, a respected divination system,
          proclaiming the need to stop the killing of twins. Another tale
          credits King Ajaka with this change, as he banned twin infanticide
          after his wife gave birth to twins. Gradually, the Yoruba began to
          honor twins as bearers of supernatural powers, believed to bring
          prosperity, joy, and protection to their families.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Celebrating Twins and Orisa Ibeji</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Today, the Yoruba regard twins as sacred, dedicating them to Orisa
          Ibeji, the deity of twins, shortly after their birth. This reverence
          is marked by grand celebrations, special dances performed by the
          mothers of twins, and rituals conducted by a Babalawo (diviner). Twins
          are showered with gifts, fine clothing, and jewelry to win their favor
          and ensure the family's prosperity. Songs, offerings, and prayers are
          made to maintain harmony and protection.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">The Role of Ere Ibeji</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          The belief that twins share a single soul is reflected in the cultural
          practice of creating ere ibeji (wooden statues) when one or both twins
          pass away. These carvings are believed to house the soul of the
          deceased twin and are treated as living entities, symbolizing the
          ongoing presence of the twins within the family. They are fed, bathed,
          and adorned with beads and jewelry, illustrating the Yoruba belief in
          the spiritual connection between the living and the dead.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Artistry of Ere Ibeji</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          These statues are created with great attention to detail, reflecting
          the rich artistic traditions of the Yoruba. Although they are not
          exact likenesses, they represent the adult forms of deceased twins,
          embellished with scarifications, elaborate hairstyles, and jewelry.
          The patina—a shiny surface that develops over years of handling during
          rituals—adds to their spiritual and aesthetic significance.
        </p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Legacy and Influence</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Today, the importance of Ibeji reaches far beyond Yorubaland. In
          diasporic communities and African-derived religions such as Santeria
          and Candomblé, twins are honored as symbols of joy and prosperity. The
          Yoruba's transformation of Ibeji from figures of fear to emblems of
          spiritual and familial unity highlights their ability to adapt and
          maintain cultural resilience.
        </p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          The narrative of Orisa Ibeji is one of redemption, illustrating how
          societies can shift from fear to reverence, celebrating the uniqueness
          of life and its connection to the divine. This legacy continues to
          foster pride and cultural identity among the Yoruba people and their
          descendants around the globe.
