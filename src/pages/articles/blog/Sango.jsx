          Sango, also known as Ṣàngó, is one of the most powerful and revered
          deities in Yoruba mythology, Nigeria. He is the god of thunder,
          lightning, and fire and is associated with strength, justice, and
          power. His story is rich with themes of ambition, power, and tragedy.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Early Life and Kingship</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Sango was a historical king of the ancient Oyo Empire, often regarded
          as its third Alaafin (king). He was the son of Oranmiyan, the founder
          of the Oyo Empire, and Bàgà, one of his wives. Known for his charisma,
          bravery, and extraordinary powers, Sango ascended to the throne and
          ruled with great might, expanding the empire and securing its
          prominence.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Mystical Powers</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Sango was said to have mystical abilities, including the power to
          control thunder and fire. His potent weapon, "Edun Ara" (the Stone of
          Thunder), could summon storms and strike his enemies. His powers made
          him feared and respected, but they also earned him rivals and enemies,
          even within his court.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Downfall</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Sango's downfall is a tale of hubris and betrayal. Some versions of
          the story suggest that his excessive pride and misuse of power angered
          the gods. Others tell of his conflict with his generals, Timi and
          Gbonka, who turned against him. In a dramatic confrontation, Sango's
          display of his powers accidentally caused the destruction of his
          palace and the death of his family. Overwhelmed with guilt and grief,
          Sango fled Oyo. According to legend, he either hanged himself on an
          Ayan tree or descended into the earth, depending on the version of the
          tale. His followers, however, believed he ascended to the heavens,
          becoming an orisha (deity) of thunder and lightning.

        <p className="ibeji-oro1">Legacy</p>
        <p className="ibeji-oro">
          Sango is celebrated in Yoruba culture and beyond. He represents
          justice, courage, and the consequences of unchecked ambition. His
          worshippers, known as the Ṣàngó devotees, hold annual festivals in his
          honor, and his sacred symbols include the oshe Ṣàngó (a double-headed
          axe) and fire imagery. His myths and historical legacy continue to
          inspire art, literature, and religious practices throughout the
          African diaspora.
